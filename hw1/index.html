      <p>
        One of the big things that I'm into at the moment is baking. I've been collecting
        recipes online and putting them to good use at the end of the week, to tasty results!
        I'm currently planning on making a cheesecake tomorrow, and am really looking forward
        to it!
      </p>

      <p>
        Another one of my hobbies is playing video games, the one currently taking most of my time being
        Final Fantasy 14 Online. The game has a great storyline, and with the new expansion Endwalker coming
        out this November, I'll have plenty to do in-game!
      </p>

        One of my favorite parts of FFXIV is the music of the game. From background music
        to boss battle themes, here's my top 10 tracks!
